It is important that this flow is not only transparent, open to inspection, but that the transparency is also resilient in the face of change.</p> <p>A bUnit process type can be characterised as a type of process that consumes one or more (input) [dataset ]{.inline-comment-marker ref=\"1bffc318-09ce-4587-a91f-806063792ffc\"}types and produces one or more new (output) [dataset ]{.inline-comment-marker ref=\"1469d260-110b-438e-8174-ac1eff4f87ea\"}types. At this level, unlike the higher levels which work with dataset collections, dataset types are individuated, where each dataset type is picked out as separate. So process types have associated flow mappings -- mappings from the individual input dataset type and to the individual output dataset type.</p> <p>The components of the bUnit flow, the bUnit process and dataset types, are identified using a name, typically reflecting its function, that is unique within the bUnit, which is often supplemented with a project-wide (code) identifier. When the bUnit dataset flow is run, the run is given an identifier. The datasets and processes in the run are identified by the combination of the type identifier and the run identifier.</p> <p>In the context of bUnit flow, a dataset is a collection of data items in a common format -- where a data item is a single unit of data. A tabular row dataset -- a common type of dataset -- is a table where the data items are the rows (these rows have an internal structure/content stored in cells based upon the table\\'s columns). Another common case is a tabular cell dataset where the data items are the table's cells themselves.</p> <p>One can visualise the bUnit flow in a number of ways. Firstly, from the perspective of the process types -- see below.</p> <p>[{.confluence-embedded-image .image-center width=\"442\" height=\"69\"}]</p> <p>Secondly from the perspective of process and dataset types, where the pipes are adorned with a dataset icon -- see below.</p> <p>[{.confluence-embedded-image .image-center width=\"442\" height=\"90\"}]</p> <p>And finally from a pure dataset type perspective, a bUnit dataset flow, showing a sequence of datasets -- see below.</p> <p>[{.confluence-embedded-image .image-center width=\"442\" height=\"89\"}][]{#Bookmark59}</p>"},{"location":"documentation/page5765136857/#Bookmark59","title":"A general notion of algorithmic dataset identity","text":"<p>In the bCLEARer stage pipeline design process, one defines (and so, in this scheme of things, gives identity to) bUnit dataset types and their associated bUnit filter types.

These names help humans keep track of the identities for the bUnit datasets and process types.

Typically, bCLEARer stage and thin slice pipelines have these gates. This dual (input and output) gate design for nested pipelines enables the original and transformed data to be inspected and compared. To assist with this, the design of an output gate\\'s data also aims to clean it sufficiently to provide a SSOT (TtDT - Report - Appendix - Aggregated S(ingle) S(ource) O(f) T(ruth){linked-resource-id=\"5773328385\" linked-resource-version=\"3\" linked-resource-type=\"page\"}) snapshot of its state at this stage of its digital journey.

The focus is on inspection not decision in an agile iterative process.</p> <p>Establishing data gates for nested pipelines, especially SSOT data gates, is a very cost effective way of creating inspection points that can greatly simplify improving and maintaining quality. It helps, for example, in the identifying of the source of problems: finding the first gate at which a problem appears, isolates between which gates it arose.

When organising these base bUnits into larger modules it is useful to consider principles of cohesion and coupling (there are more details on this in TtDT - Report - Appendix - cohesion and coupling{linked-resource-id=\"5772804097\" linked-resource-version=\"4\" linked-resource-type=\"page\"}).</p> <p>Cohesion is a measure of [functional ]{.inline-comment-marker ref=\"8cf28bb0-f7d6-43d7-aff2-5959e93468f9\"}closeness - and a good modular design will have high cohesion where the [functional ]{.inline-comment-marker ref=\"4448be20-3f88-404c-8354-c62f4eadf689\"}closeness is high inside the modules and low outside.

Many types of transformations occur repeatedly in practice, and so it is desirable to create these as independent, reusable parts.</p> <p>Problem: Such systems need to be divided into reusable, loosely coupled components with simple, generic interaction mechanisms. In this way they can be flexibly combined with each other. The components, being generic and loosely coupled, are easily reused. The components, being independent, can execute in parallel.</p> <p>Solution: The pattern of interaction in the pipe-and-filter pattern is characterized by successive transformations of streams of data. Data arrives at a filter\\'s input port(s), is transformed, and then is passed via its output port(s) through a pipe to the next filter. A single filter can consume data from, or produce data to, one or more ports.</p> <p>Data transformation systems are typically structured as pipes and filters, with each filter responsible for one part of the overall transformation of the input data. The independent processing at each step supports reuse, parallelization, and simplified reasoning about overall behaviour. Often such systems constitute the front end of signal-processing applications. These systems receive sensor data at a set of initial filters; each of these filters compresses the data and performs initial processing (such as smoothing). Downstream filters reduce the data further and do synthesis across data derived from different sensors. The final filter typically passes its data to an application, for example providing input to modelling or visualization tools</p>"},{"location":"documentation/page5784338433/#Bookmark226","title":"Key terms","text":"<p>+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | term    | description                                       | +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | Overview    | Data is transformed from a system\\'s external inputs  | |             | to its external outputs through a series of           | |             | transformations performed by its filters connected by | |             | pipes.                                                | +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | Elements    | Filter, which is a component that transforms data   | |             | read on its input port(s) to data written on its      | |             | output port(s).
