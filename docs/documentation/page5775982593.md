solution to a design problem'.]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="543c040c-4ee9-42e9-967a-d54f4c11dcdf"}

\'Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice.\'

The range of situations in which a pattern can be used is called its
context.

[In software engineering, ]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="5abec469-1c7f-4afb-bfe5-26d583ca04fa"}a software design pattern is
a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a
given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can
be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a
description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in
many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices
that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an
application or system.

An
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern){.external-link

project management, and business processes is a common response to a
recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly
counterproductive.

As opposed to a bad practice

-   An anti-pattern is a commonly-used process, structure or pattern of
    action that, despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and
    effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good
    ones

-   Another solution exists to the problem the anti-pattern is
    attempting to address. This solution is documented, repeatable, and
    proven to be effective where the anti-pattern is not
