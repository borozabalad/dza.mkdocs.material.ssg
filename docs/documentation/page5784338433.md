# History {#Bookmark222}

Doug McIlroy introduced the 'pipe-and-filter' architectureÂ in Unix in
1972. Ritchie \[[ref: Ritchie, 1984]{style="color: rgb(191,38,0);"}\]
gives a detailed description of this. It subsequently became known as
'pipeline' architecture. Since then it has become an accepted
architecture or architectural pattern and documented in the standard
text books; the extract below is an example. It is now commonly used in
compliers and data engineering.

Particular applications often have a more detailed architecture. For
example, compilers typically have a three stage pipeline architecture:

1.  front-end: parses input language into an intermediate language

2.  middle: performs transformations in the intermediate language

3.  back-end: translates the intermediate language into the output
    language

The use of an intermediate language allows for reusable architectural
components.

*Software Architecture in Practice* is one of the standard textbooks on
software architecture. It describes architectures in terms of patterns.
This extract provides the 'standard' view of pipe-and-filter

### Pipe-and-Filter Pattern {#Bookmark225}

**Context:** Many systems are required to transform streams of discrete
data items, from input to output. Many types of transformations occur
repeatedly in practice, and so it is desirable to create these as
independent, reusable parts.

**Problem:** Such systems need to be divided into reusable, loosely
coupled components with simple, generic interaction mechanisms. In this
way they can be flexibly combined with each other. The components, being
generic and loosely coupled, are easily reused. The components, being
independent, can execute in parallel.

**Solution:** The pattern of interaction in the pipe-and-filter pattern
is characterized by successive transformations of streams of data. Data
arrives at a filter\'s input port(s), is transformed, and then is passed
via its output port(s) through a pipe to the next filter. A single
filter can consume data from, or produce data to, one or more ports.

> Data transformation systems are typically structured as pipes and
> filters, with each filter responsible for one part of the overall
> transformation of the input data. The independent processing at each
> step supports reuse, parallelization, and simplified reasoning about
> overall behaviour. Often such systems constitute the front end of
> signal-processing applications. These systems receive sensor data at a
> set of initial filters; each of these filters compresses the data and
> performs initial processing (such as smoothing). Downstream filters
> reduce the data further and do synthesis across data derived from
> different sensors. The final filter typically passes its data to an
> application, for example providing input to modelling or visualization
> tools


### Key terms {#Bookmark226}


+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **term**    | **description**                                       |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Overview    | Data is transformed from a system\'s external inputs  |
|             | to its external outputs through a series of           |
|             | transformations performed by its filters connected by |
|             | pipes.                                                |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Elements    | *Filter*, which is a component that transforms data   |
|             | read on its input port(s) to data written on its      |
|             | output port(s). Filters can execute concurrently with |
|             | each other. Filters can incrementally transform data; |
|             | that is, they can start producing output as soon as   |
|             | they start processing input. Important                |
|             | characteristics include processing rates,             |
|             | input/output data formats, and the transformation     |
|             | executed by the filter.                               |
|             |                                                       |
|             | *Pipe*, which is a connector that conveys data from a |
|             | filter\'s output port(s) to another filter\'s input   |
|             | port(s). A pipe has a single source for its input and |
|             | a single target for its output. A pipe preserves the  |
|             | sequence of data items, and it does not alter the     |
|             | data passing through. Important characteristics       |
|             | include buffer size, protocol of interaction,         |
|             | transmission speed, and format of the data that       |
|             | passes through a pipe.                                |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Relations   | The *attachment* relation associates the output of    |
|             | filters with the input of pipes and vice versa.       |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Constraints | Pipes connect filter output ports to filter input     |
|             | ports.                                                |
|             |                                                       |
|             | Connected filters must agree on the type of data      |
|             | being passed along the connecting pipe.               |
|             |                                                       |
|             | Specializations of the pattern may restrict the       |
|             | association of components to an acyclic graph or a    |
|             | linear sequence, sometimes called a pipeline.         |
|             |                                                       |
|             | Other specializations may prescribe that components   |
|             | have certain named ports, such as the *stdln*,        |
|             | *stdout*, and *stderr* ports of UNIX filters.         |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Weaknesses  | The pipe-and-filter pattern is typically not a good   |
|             | choice for an interactive system.                     |
|             |                                                       |
|             | Having large numbers of independent filters can add   |
|             | substantial amounts of computational overhead.        |
|             |                                                       |
|             | Pipe-and-filter systems may not be appropriate for    |
|             | long-running computations.                            |
